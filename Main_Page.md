Introduction
------------

FreeON is an experimental, open source (GPL) suite of programs for linear scaling quantum chemistry, formerly known as MondoSCF. It is highly modular, and has been written from scratch for N-scaling SCF theory in Fortran95 and C. Platform independent I/O is supported with HDF5. FreeON should compile with most modern Linux distributions. FreeON performs Hartree-Fock, pure Density Functional, and hybrid HF/DFT calculations (e.g. B3LYP) in a Cartesian-Gaussian LCAO basis. All algorithms are *O(N)* or ''O(N *log* N)'' for non-metallic systems. Periodic boundary conditions in 1, 2 and 3 dimensions have been implemented through the Lorentz field (Γ-point), and an internal coordinate geometry optimizer allows full (atom+cell) relaxation using analytic derivatives. Effective core potentials for energies and forces have been implemented, but Effective Core Potential (ECP) lattice forces do not work yet. Advanced features include *O(N)* static and dynamic response, as well as time reversible Born Oppenheimer Molecular Dynamics (MD).

While you could e-mail one of the authors directly, we prefer if you used our mailing lists or our bug tracker instead. You will probably get a response quicker this way because your message will go to all of us as opposed to just one of us. We currently operate 2 mailing lists:

-   [freeon-users](http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/freeon-users), our public mailing list for users of FreeON.
-   [freeon-devel](http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/freeon-devel), our mailing list for developers of FreeON, and people who are interested in the development process of it.

Alternatively you can file a bug report or feature request with our bug tracker system:

-   [FreeON Bug Tracker](https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?group=freeon)
